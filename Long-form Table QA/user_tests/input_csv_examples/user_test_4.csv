In 2008, with David Walters as the best pitcher with a 7-3 record and an average of 1.72, the team secured 28 wins and 26 losses, indicating that his performance may have contributed to the winning ratio. In 2013, despite Noah Buettgen's strong individual performance of 3 wins and 2 losses and an average of 2.35, the team only had 17 wins and as many as 32 losses, suggesting a great pitcher's influence could be overshadowed by the team's overall performance. Similarly, in 2015, Steven Piette was the best pitcher with a 1-1 record but a very low average of 0.82; however, the team only managed to secure 22 wins and 33 losses, suggesting that even an excellent individual performance could not necessarily uplift the team's results. This analysis suggests that while a strong pitcher can positively influence the team's win-loss record, the overall team performance is not solely dependent on the best pitcher's performance.","In years Owls no make playoffs, their win-loss records were like this: 28-26 in 2008, 17-32 in 2013, 22-33 in 2015.
