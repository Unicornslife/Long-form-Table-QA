In general, the team batting first has the advantage of setting a target for the team batting second, putting pressure on them to chase a challenging total. Additionally, the team batting first can take advantage of the conditions of the pitch, whether it be early moisture or deteriorating conditions later in the game. On the other hand, the team batting second has the advantage of knowing the target they need to chase and can plan their innings accordingly, considering the required run rate and the number of overs remaining. They also have the advantage of having seen the opposition's batting performance, providing useful insights and strategic advantages. However, it is important to note that the effect of teams' innings on their chances of winning or losing is not fixed and can vary depending on various factors, making it a dynamic and situational aspect of the game. In terms of losing the match, teams' innings directly correlate with the number of opportunities they have to score runs and take wickets. Having more innings increases the chances of losing as it allows the opposing team more opportunities to outperform them and potentially secure a victory.","From table, we can see that team bat first (Inns. 1) win match in 10 out of 16 times, and team bat second (Inns. 2) win in 6 out of 16 times.
